[A theory of everyone](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/101526285), *by Michael Muthukrishna*.

This book defines 4 "laws"

## Law of Energy
Energy is central to life. We cannot move, reproduce nor maintain homeostasis without it. The ultimate ceiling for what's possible to achieve is the availability of energy to do so.

## Law of Innovation
How life find new ways to efficiently capture and control energy.

Example of innovations are biological - photosynthesis, the ability to digest meat or milk -, technologies - farming or the engine - or social - corporations and countries. All of them increase the the amount of energy available.

## Law of cooperation
Ways in which life benefits from working together in order to unlock more energy sources or efficiencies.

The optimal level of cooperation is the one in which each individual in a group can get a larger share of the spoils (or energy) than in a smaller or larger group. 

## Law of Evolution
Life trying different strategies in the competition over resources and energy.
The previous underlying laws are part of an evolutionary process: a try and error attempt, with winners overcrowding losers.


## Summary
The gist of the book is about how these 4 laws are interconnected. In life's quest for energy we eventually find some innovation that incentivizes us to cooperate in greater scales. This behavior is then amplified by cultural evolution.

Until 1700s, the energy ceiling remained low. The amount of work humans could do depended on their manual labour or the labour of the animals they domesticated, slightly enhanced by some tools (ladders, pulleys, etc). The excess energy  wasn't large enough to achieve greater frontiers. Then coal, natural gas and oil were discovered: stored solar energy that algae had slowly converted in chemical form. 
One can calculate the excess of energy using EROI (Energy Return of Investment), which is the ratio of how much energy you spend into getting some energy back. For hunter gatherers there is a small amount of energy one get back from eating a prey after we take into account the amount of energy invested into hunting it down.
The EROI for difference [storage technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_return_on_investment) varies over time: in 1919 the EROI of oil was 1000 (with the energy present in 1 barrel of oil you could find 1000 more) while today is estimated to be ~ 5.

Higher excess energy means higher innovation since the amount of effort put into harnessing energy can be put into something else. And those innovations at the same time can create even higher excess energy. One example from the book is the Green Revolution: an innovation that allowed turning fossil fuels into fertilizers and pesticides, making farms more productive. It is considered that due to the Green Revolution alone the human population was doubled.

Higher excess energy also means increased scale of cooperation since new innovations require higher degree of cooperation. We cooperate to compete, compete by  cooperating.

However, there is a cyclical pattern:
1. A new energy source increase the EROI.
2. Population increases.
3. Positive-sum conditions (when someone else success predicts your success) incentivize people to cooperate in order to exploit that new energy source
4. Higher cooperation leads to higher innovation.
5. Higher innovation leads to doing more with less energy/
6. Less people are required to exploit that energy source.
7. The rest of the people can enjoy the excess energy to make their life better.
8. Since less people are required to access the new energy source, it can lead to lower scales of cooperation (feudalism, aristocracies, oligarchies, corruption) that try to control that wealth.
9. This leads to lower cooperation, zero-sum conditions (when someone else failure is your success) innovation and quality of life.
